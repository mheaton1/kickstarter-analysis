# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of the project 
###### Louise was looking to fundraise for her play *Fever*. She estimated that her cost would be around $10,000. She wanted to get an idea of how feesable this goal was before she went forward. The compiled data was large and impossible to read. There was certain criteria that Louise wanted to compare the results of her fundraising to. I believe she wanted to compare her results against other results if she had more time to fundraise or less time. 
## Analysis and Challenges
###### I did have some troubles with the countif function with excel.

###### I had forgotten to include the filters of "plays" in my functions. I was confused as to why my number of successful goals were so high. That was until I went back to the directions and was able to see that they wanted us to include the extra subcategory of "plays". I was also struggling when it came to canceled. I wasn't understanding why everything was coming out with zeros. I had deleted and re-entered the 'countifs' function multiple times before I realized that I wont produce any data because it was canceled. I feel as though that would have been a common challenge others may face or it may have been an obvious prediction.
