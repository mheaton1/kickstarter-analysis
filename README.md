# Kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of the project
###### Louise was looking to fundraise for her play *Fever*. She estimated that her cost would be around $10,000. She wanted to get an idea of how feesable this goal was before she went forward. The compiled data was large and impossible to read. There was certain criteria that Louise wanted to compare the results of her fundraising to. I believe she wanted to compare her results against other results if she had more time to fundraise or less time. 
## Analysis and Challenges
######  I did have some troubles with the countif function with excel.

######  I had forgotten to include the filters of "plays" in my functions. I was confused as to why my number of successful goals were so high. That was until I went back to the directions and was able to see that they wanted us to include the extra subcategory of "plays". I was also struggling when it came to canceled. I wasn't understanding why everything was coming out with zeros. I had deleted and re-entered the 'countifs' function multiple times before I realized that I wont produce any data because it was canceled. I feel as though that would have been a common challenge others may face or it may have been an obvious prediction.  
## Results 
######  There are a few conclusions that can be made from the graph that icludes the Theater Outcomes by Launch date.

######  From the graph we can conclude that the number of successful theater campaigns is significantally higher during the month of may. We can also conclude that there are signifcantly more successful campaigns than failed campaigns. During the peak month of May there is more than double the amount of successful campaigns than failed, even though there is a slight peak in the failed campaigns as well.  
###### There are a few conclusions that cane be made from the Outcomes Based on Goals graph.

 ###### It appears that the date is the complete opposite of eachother from the graph. Meaning, you can conclude that the lower the fundrasing goal the higher the success rate. However, goals with a range of $15,000-%19,999 have a 50% chance of success or failure. The highest fundraising goals is where the number of failed outcomes peaks, it is also where the number of successful outcomes is at its lowest. Thus, relating to the first conclusion in which the higher the goal the lower the success rate. 
 ###### I think some of the limitations is location. We can filter the data by country however there may be wealthier areas that would have better chances of reaching the fund raising goals. For example, a theater campaigned and promoted in New York City will most likely reach it's goal over a theater production campagin in a suburban town in New Jersey. Both campaigns are in the US however, one is more likely to succeed than the other because of specific location. 
 ###### I think the graph "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date" could be filtered down specifically to plays like we did for the "Outcomes based on Goals". Since Louise is fundrasing for a play the information provided is more relevant to her cause.

###### As you can see there were no cancelled campaigns for plays so it is not indicated on this graph. Filtering this information this way may have helped during the challange I encounted with the 'countifs' function.
